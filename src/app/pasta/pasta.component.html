    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil water. This will take 47 years. Do not watch it.</li>
      <li>Add salt. More. No, more than that. Perfect.</li>
      <li>Add pasta. Stir once and then forget about it for exactly too long.</li>
      <li>Realize the pasta is sticking. Panic. Stir aggressively.</li>
      <li>Drain pasta but burn yourself on the steam. Curse loudly.</li>
      <li>Dump entire jar of sauce on pasta. Mix it like you mean it.</li>
      <li>Add cheese until you can no longer see the pasta.</li>
      <li>Eat directly from the pot because dishes are for quitters.</li>
